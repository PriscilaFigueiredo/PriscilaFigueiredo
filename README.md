# Hi üëã  my name is Priscila Vieira  
<br>
I'm your software testing friend üë©‚Äçüíª. Lover of quality testing, ü§ñ enthusiast of agile practices.
<br>
Passionate about reliable, high-quality software. üöÄ

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
ü§ù I'm looking for opportunities to collaborate on software quality and testing projects. As a test analyst, I'm skilled at diving into requirements, putting together thorough test cases, and running functional and regression tests. I'm all about making sure software products are top-notch, reliable, and perform well.
And I'm always striving to sharpen my skills and share what I know with the team.
<br>
<br>

üß† I‚Äôm currently learning Front-end test automation tools, using Cypress and Robot, enhancing my skills in back-end testing with Postman and JavaScript.
